## The Why

I read too fast. (It's not a good thing. People should savor their books.)

And because I read too fast, I always need a new book. Every couple of weeks I'm emailing, texting, calling my friends and family:

> "Any good sci-fi you've read this year?"

> "What's your favorite memoir?

> Do you have a hard copy I could borrow?"

I have all the same access to Amazon and Goodreads reviews just like everyone else, but I trust my family & friends' recommendations more than the masses.

And it's wonderful to finish a book and have people you can discuss it with!

That's where BookBound comes in. BookBound is a web application dedicated to sharing your favorite books with those you love and finding your next book from those you trust.
